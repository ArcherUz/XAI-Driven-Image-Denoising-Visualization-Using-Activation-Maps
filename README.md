# XAI Driven Image Denoising Visualization Using Activation Maps
Co-workers: Md Ridwan Hasan(mdridwan@ualberta.ca), Tingyang Jiao(tingyang@ualberta.ca), Pengcheng Yan(py@ualberta.ca)

Our groupâ€™s purpose in this project is to visualize and analyze the performance of an existing denoising model using XAI techniques like activation maps on different types of image datasets with different types of noises and compare the performances.

We reviewed existing works for image denosing
